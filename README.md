# HTML_CSS_Refactor

This is a basic readme and I will list my changes here:
1. Changed title to just the name of the company
2. Line 68 we changed the image tag to be self closing for consistency
3. renamed the big image to figure to be more semantic
4. Changed a few divs to be more semantic (aside, footer and main)
5. In the CSS file there were 3 copies of .benefits h3. Removed 2 of them
